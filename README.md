## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
Here you can find some information about SourceBans++ 2.0


### When will SourceBans++ 2.0 be released?
ETA (Estimated time of arrival) is still unknown. We don't want to rush SourceBans++ 2.0 and possible release a broken piece of software. Could be a few weeks or a few months.
Also, we are currently working on SourceBans++ 1.6.0, so development for 2.0 halts until 1.6.0 is released.

### How can I contribute?
At the time you sadly can't. We don't need help at the time as most parts of the framework, etc. are planned we just try to simplify everything.
However, there will be an 'Open Beta' phase where we need all help we can get to find and fix as many bugs as possible.

### How can my question be included in this FAQ?
Send me an email with your question to groruk@uberdoge.network, and I will add them to the FAQ.
